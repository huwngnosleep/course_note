# virtualization is provide abstractions for multiple computers to be treated as a single computer for users

**hypervisor** is a software to act as hardware for OS to running on it

# type of virtualization

- full virtualization: copy full feature of an OS to run over hypervisor
  - benefit: no need of OS modifications
  - disadvantages: some feature may not satisfied, and we are not noticed about them

- para-virtualization: modify OS to optimize performance when interacting with hypervisor, remove over-privilege instructions, but don't support all OS
- software-assisted virtualization: virtualization is built natively in hardware (CPU support virtualization) and OS can directly talk to hardware to get rid of hypervisor performance issue
- OS-virtualization: allow containers run as processes on a single Operating System and don't need hypervisor
