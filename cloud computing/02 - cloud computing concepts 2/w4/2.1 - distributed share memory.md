multi machine share the same pages of memory, each page mapping to machine local memory

# invalidate protocol

owner is the process with latest version of the page

each page is either in READ or WRITE state

- all processes have the same R copy
- but only owner have W copy

when a process attempt to write to a page (page in ready for write state):
- multicast to other processes to tell them **invalidate** their copies
- become owner of that page
- do write
- send copy to other processes

# invalidate protocol downside
- lots of network transfer
- need to choose page size 

# not widely used today
