Iterate each vertex
1, gather data from adjacent neighbors
2, do computation using it's value and neighbors value
3, update it's value and send to neighbor

iteration terminate if:
- reach a fixed iteration
- vertices stop changing values

# distributed graph processing
- assign vertices to servers
  - hash-based approach
  - locality-based: assign vertices with more neighbors to the same server as it's neighbor -> reduce communication cost
