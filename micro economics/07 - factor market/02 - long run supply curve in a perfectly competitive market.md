but this is a perfectly competitive market, so there is no boundary for entry/exit, so more Firms will enter the market (because of positive revenue). Then, the market price will reduce

if the cost structure of all Firms in the market are equal (because of perfectly competitive market), then at some point of time, the market price will be equal to all Firms' ATC, then there is not any economic revenue can be made

then the demand curve, will be constant

if the costs are not constant, more firm entering the market will make costs go up
