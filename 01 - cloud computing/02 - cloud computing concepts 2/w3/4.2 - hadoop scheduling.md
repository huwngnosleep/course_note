# Hadoop capacity scheduler
- multiple queue
- each queue contains multiple jobs
- each queue is given some portion of the cluster capacity
- FIFO often used within same queue

# Hadoop fair scheduler
- goal: all jobs get equal share of resources
- when only one job, occupies entire cluster
- when another job arrive, each job has equal % of cluster

- each pool has % minimum share of the cluster
- when minimum share not met -> take resources away from other pool by killing jobs and try to restart later (with idempotent tasks)
