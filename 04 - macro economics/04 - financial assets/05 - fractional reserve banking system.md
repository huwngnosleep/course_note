when central bank issue money, assume that people lend all that money in a bank, then that bank have to keep a faction of that money inside it, then lend out the rest to the market, somehow that money goes into another bank. This form our fractional reserve banking system.

To avoid people from taking their money out at the same time together, banks issue **checks**, which can be used as money, without taking money out from bank to afford transactions.

when a bank in the system get into a problem make it cannot retrieve the loan, or it can not pay all the checks -> this can lead to the destruction chain off all reserve banking system
